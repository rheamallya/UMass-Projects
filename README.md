Project: A cookbook that stores a list of recipes that the user can search through to find different recipes based on their category of choice. They are able to search and see the listed ingredients of the desired recipe, and links are provided for detailed recipes. The user can choose a category (appetizer, full course, and dessert) then there will be other options that vary for each category to select your desired recipe. Furthermore, each category has a special function. For appetizer, you are able to favorite any recipes and those recipes will be displayed in a “favorites” document, the main course filters out cheeses from the recipes, and the dessert asks for the user’s desired serving size that will be used to alter the amount of ingredients used in the recipe.

This Python program demonstrates my knowledge in key programming concepts like code organization, string manipulation, code managing user inputs, employing class and objects by utilizing OOP. There was file handling, where I read from a CSV file and wrote to another. The program effectively filters data using data filtering, handling user inputs for category and recipe type. It employs conditional statements and loops for decision-making and iteration. The use of functions like write_recipe_to_file protrays my ability in implementing function definition.
